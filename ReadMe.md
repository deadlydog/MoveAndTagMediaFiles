# Move and Tag Media Files

ðŸš§ This project is still a work in progress under construction. ðŸš§

## Description

This application allows you to preview large numbers of media files (images, videos, audio) and easily copy or move specific ones to another directory, as well as optionally add tags to them.

## Why this exists

My dog died and I wanted to gather all of the photos I had of her to put them on a digital photo frame, dedicated solely for pictures of her.
This meant combing through tens of thousands of photos from the past decade and separating out the ones she was in, which was a very time consuming process.
This app is meant to make that process quicker and easier.
For me it was photos of my dog, but you may want to quickly copy/move/tag images of something else, such as your child's sporting events, or your office coworkers.

## Quick start

Run the MoveAndTagMediaFiles.exe application, choose your source and destination directories, and search for files.
